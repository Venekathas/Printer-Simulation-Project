# Printer-Simulation-Project
This was a project I did for school. We had to take an existing file and annotate it. In this case, a simulation of a printer in a classroom. We had to consider the addition of a second printer. The configurations for the experiment are submitted through a .txt file. The results of the simulation are output to another .txt file.
